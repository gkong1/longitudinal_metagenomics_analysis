# longitudinal_metagenomics_analysis
The code for the analysis of the fecal metagenomics data are provided here.

For the independent short chain fatty acid (SCFA) assay analysis: the normalized concentrations of acetate, butyrate and propionate of wild-type (WT) and R6/1 (HD) mice at 12 weeks of age were included in the file "matrix with FCS_conc.csv". These mice were of the same cohort as the ones for the longitudinal shotgun sequencing experiment. The analysis file for the SCFA data ("scfa_analysis") includes the code for one-way ANOVA statistical test as well as for plotting barplots.
